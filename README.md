# Data Analysis Lab: Numpy, Pandas, and EDA 
This repository contains the Python implementation for today's lab session, focusing on core data science libraries: NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The work transitions from basic array manipulation to structured data analysis and visualization using the Iris dataset.

## 📋 Tasks Overview
### 1. NumPy Array Operations:
- Created a 3x3 matrix and analyzed its shape and dimensions.
- Conditional Logic: Filtered the array to replace all values $> 10$ with $0$.
- Matrix Arithmetic: Performed element-wise addition, multiplication, and calculated the square root of matrices.

### 2. Pandas Series & DataFrames: 
- Series Filtering: Converted a dictionary of student marks into a Pandas Series and extracted high-scorers (Score $> 75$).
- Statistical Analysis: Calculated the mean and max values of the dataset.
- DataFrame Management: Created an employee database DataFrame.
Filtered records by the IT Department.
Sorted the data by Salary in descending order.

###3. Iris Dataset EDA
- Data Ingestion: Loaded the Iris.csv dataset.
-  Summary Statistics: Utilized .describe() and .shape to gain an initial understanding of the data distribution.
- Data Visualization: Generated a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between Sepal Length and Petal Length.

## Implementation Details 
### Libraries Used 
- Pandas: For data structures and CSV handling.
- NumPy: For numerical operations and multi-dimensional arrays.
- Matplotlib: For generating static visualizations.
